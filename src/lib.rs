// -------------------
// IMG TO ASCII
// -------------------
// 
// How does it work?
//  1. We get image bits as a parameter.
//  2. An iteration is made for every pixel in 
//     the image. Note that we have a set of
//     character.
//
//     darkest -> brightest
//
//     We decide the brightness of a pixel by
//     making the average of the RGB value. RGB
//     values are store at numbers in the range
//     of 0 to 255. So, if we have rgb(255, 255, 255)
//     it is white and if we have rgb(0, 0, 0) it will
//     be black.
//
//     example pixel:
//
//        255 --------- | --------- 0
//                ^
//               137
//
//        We can see that this pixel has a brighter
//        value as it is closer to 255. We get the
//        average of those 3 numbers (ignoring Alpha)
//        and get the character index depending on the
//        average.

extern crate image;

  // Options (default)
  let resolution = 5;

  // Create a new instance of a string.
  // Here is where the ascii art will
  // be stored as a result.
  let ascii_art = String::new()


  let sm = img.resize(img.width() / resolution, img.height() / resolution, FilterType::Nearest);
